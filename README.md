# This is an abridged version of the Pervasive Digital serialwifi library

## [Pervasive Digital serialwifi library](https://github.com/PervasiveDigital/serialwifi)

It has been modified to compile with .NetMF 4.3 and TinyCLR

The souce code should be included as a separate compile module in your project

As it stands the code supports running as a station, not an AP, and connecting as client via a TCP socket
There have been several changes to fix reliability issues, and the code is running in production environments.
See git log for details

No simple use example yet, but if there is any interest I can put something together when time allows
